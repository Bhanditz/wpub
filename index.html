            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                
                <p>For millenia now, the written word has been the primary means of encoding and sharing ideas and
                    information. The publication as a bounded edition, made public, has been used to carry intellectual and
                    artistic works of innumerable form: novels, plays, poetry, journals, magazines, newspapers, articles,
                    laws, treatises, pamphlets, atlases, comics, manga, notebooks, memos, manuals, and albums of all
                    sorts.</p>
                
                <p>More recently, with the advent of the information age, print has been ceding ground to digital, and the
                    Web has become a major forum for the public dissemination of ideas. But the Web is unbounded: information
                    and resources are only loosely connected through hyperlinks. While this model has helped the Web thrive
                    in many areas, it has proven problematic for traditional information publishing—users often cannot access
                    works in their entirety, especially when offline, and have not been able to easily access, compile and
                    download content for curation and personal use. That, in turn, has fed the continuing development of
                    non-Web document formats to redress these problems, and made it necessary to create both Web-ready
                    content and alternative offline renditions to ensure publications are fully available.</p>
                
                <p>This specification aims to reduce these barriers and reinvigorate publishing by combining the best aspects
                    of both models—the persistent availability and portability of bounded publications with the pervasive
                    accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform.</p>

            <section id="scope">
                <h3>Scope</h3>
                
                <p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
                    Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
                    achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the way
                    that the Web itself operates.</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
                    technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
                    evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific versions).</p>
                
                <p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type of
                    work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>

                <h3>Web Publications</h3>
                
                <div class="ednote">
                    <p>This section was adapted from the Interest Group document as an initial placeholder. The actual makeup
                        of Web Publications may change significantly as development progresses. The section will be updated
                        as features and functionality are formalized.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>The act of publishing involves obtaining resources, organizing them into a publication and making that
                    publication available on a Web server. In doing so, the publisher establishes the interconnectedness that
                    binds the resources into a single work. This process also provides an origin for the Web Publication and
                    a URL that uniquely identifies it, giving provenance to the work.</p>
                
                <p>The establishment of this discoverable and identifiable collection is what enables users to access their
                    content without concern for whether they are online or offline. The user agent can cache the resources
                    ensuring that the Web Publication is available and functional while offline, providing the user, as much
                    as possible, a seamless experience interacting with a Web Publication regardless of their network
                    connection.</p>
                
                <p>The Web Publication introduces the concept of a manifest, which serves to carry information about the
                    constituent resources of the publication. The manifest includes metadata that describes the publication
                    as a whole, as it has an identity and nature beyond its constituent resources. The metadata and manifest
                    also incorporate information about the sequence and presentation of the content.</p>
                
                <p>A Web Publication also provides a default ordering of its primary constituent resources, although that
                    order may be changed by user interaction or scripting. The user is able to access any primary resource
                    directly via navigation provided by the publication itself or via the user agent.</p>
