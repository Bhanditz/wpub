			<p>This specification defines digital publishing based on a fully native representation of documents within the
				Open Web Platform: <a>Web Publications</a> work both online and offline and can be packaged and made
				portable.</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section>
				<h3>Background</h3>

				<p>For millenia now, the written word has been the primary means of encoding and sharing ideas and
					information. The publication as a bounded edition, made public, has been used to carry intellectual and
					artistic works of innumerable form: novels, plays, poetry, journals, magazines, newspapers, articles,
					laws, treatises, pamphlets, atlases, comics, manga, notebooks, memos, manuals, and albums of all
					sorts.</p>

				<p>More recently, with the advent of the information age, print has been ceding ground to digital, and the
					Web has become a major forum for the public dissemination of ideas. But the Web is unbounded: information
					and resources are only loosely connected through hyperlinks. While this model has helped the Web thrive
					in many areas, it has proven problematic for traditional information publishing—users often cannot access
					works in their entirety, especially when offline, and have not been able to easily access, compile and
					download content for curation and personal use. That, in turn, has fed the continuing development of
					non-Web document formats to redress these problems, and made it necessary to create both Web-ready
					content and alternative offline renditions to ensure publications are fully available.</p>

				<p>This specification aims to reduce these barriers and reinvigorate publishing by combining the best aspects
					of both models—the persistent availability and portability of bounded publications with the pervasive
					accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="scope">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification only defines requirements for the production and rendering of valid <a>Web
						Publications</a>. As much as possible, it leverages existing Open Web Platform technologies to
					achieve its goal—that being to allow for a measure of boundedness on the Web without changing the way
					that the Web itself operates.</p>

				<p>Moreover, the specification is designed to adapt automatically to updates to Open Web Platform
					technologies in order to ensure that Web Publications continue to interoperate seamlessly as the Web
					evolves (e.g., by referencing the latest published versions instead of specific versions).</p>

				<p>Further, this specification does not attempt to constrain the nature of a Web Publication: any type of
					work that can be represented on the Web constitutes a potential Web Publication.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="nature">
				<h3>Web Publications</h3>

				<div class="ednote">
					<p>This section was adapted from the Interest Group document as an initial placeholder. The actual makeup
						of Web Publications may change significantly as development progresses. The section will be updated
						as features and functionality are formalized.</p>
				</div>

				<p>The act of publishing involves obtaining resources, organizing them into a publication and making that
					publication available on a Web server. In doing so, the publisher establishes the interconnectedness that
					binds the resources into a single work. This process also provides an origin for the Web Publication and
					a URL that uniquely identifies it, giving provenance to the work.</p>

				<p>The establishment of this discoverable and identifiable collection is what enables users to access their
					content without concern for whether they are online or offline. The user agent can cache the resources
					ensuring that the Web Publication is available and functional while offline, providing the user, as much
					as possible, a seamless experience interacting with a Web Publication regardless of their network
					connection.</p>

				<p>The Web Publication introduces the concept of a manifest, which serves to carry information about the
					constituent resources of the publication. The manifest includes metadata that describes the publication
					as a whole, as it has an identity and nature beyond its constituent resources. The metadata and manifest
					also incorporate information about the sequence and presentation of the content.</p>

				<p>A Web Publication also provides a default ordering of its primary constituent resources, although that
					order may be changed by user interaction or scripting. The user is able to access any primary resource
					directly via navigation provided by the publication itself or via the user agent.</p>

			<h2>Terminology</h2>

			<dl>
				<dt><dfn>Default Reading Order</dfn></dt>
				<dd><p>The default reading order is the static progression through the <a>primary resources</a>. It is
						defined in the <a>manifest</a> by the creator of a <a>Web Publication</a>.</p>
					<p>A user might follow alternative pathways through the content, but in the absence of such interaction
						the default reading order defines the expected progression from one primary resource to the
					next.</p></dd>

				<dt><dfn data-lt="Manifests">Manifest</dfn></dt>
				<dd><p>A manifest represents structured information about a <a>Web Publication</a>, such as informative
						metadata and the <a>default reading order</a> of its <a>primary resources</a>.</p></dd>

				<dt><dfn data-lt="Primary Resources">Primary Resource</dfn></dt>
				<dd><p>A primary resource is a resource listed in the <a>default reading order</a> of a <a>Web
							Publication</a>.</p>
					<p>A primary resource typically references many secondary resources necessary for it to be correctly
						processed and rendered (e.g., style sheets, scripts, multimedia files).</p></dd>

				<dt><dfn data-lt="User Agents">User Agent</dfn></dt>
				<dd><p>A user agent is any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates user interaction with a <a>Web
							Publication</a>.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><dfn data-lt="Web Publications">Web Publication</dfn></dt>
				<dd><p>A Web Publication is a collection of one or more <a>primary resources</a>, organized together through
						a <a>manifest</a> into a single logical work with a <a>default reading order</a>. The Web Publication
						is uniquely identifiable, presentable using Open Web Platform technologies, and available online or
						off.</p></dd>
